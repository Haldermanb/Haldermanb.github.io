    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Brandon Halderman and I am currently in Cleveland Institute of Art for the Animation project. I am a freshman in college and close to being on christmas break. I also have a 2nd major out side of CIA. I want to be an actor so I have been going to a different school. I have a great time there and improv is one of my favorites to do there. I have been going there for 7 years and plan on stoping in the next 3 to 4 years. I started enjoying art at a young age, but didn't get into it until my softmore year of high school. During my softmore year I went to a community college called CVCC and I learn a lot about the art field. I took some classes at CIA during CVCC, which brought me here. Those classes inspire to come to this college.</p>
